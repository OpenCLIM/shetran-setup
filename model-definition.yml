  summary: Creates input data for SHETRAN based on a catchment mask
  source_code: https://github.com/OpenCLIM/shetran-setup
  description: >
    Sets up input data using UKCP18 12km projections for rainfall, PET and temperature.
    Either 1980-2010 (control) or 2040-2070 (future) scenarios can be modelled using 1 of 12 ensemble members.
    Any catchment mask within the UK can be used to generate SHETRAN inputs.
